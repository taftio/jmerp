Chaos, INC.'s JMERP Framework v1.0
-----------------------------
The vision is a rather robust implemenation of the rules of the Middle
Earth Role Playing system, implemented using JavaBeans(TM) and XML data
files.  In theory, the components built could be easily used by others
to plug into another user interface (such as web or just a prettier
java interface).

Feel free to throw the JAR file into a development kit and reuse the
beans that exists.  Documentation, in the form of a JavaDoc, will
soon exist on the production site.

If you need to contact the developer, please e-mail him at:

If you modify, improve or use this software, feel free to notify the
developer.  I'd love to hear about it.
