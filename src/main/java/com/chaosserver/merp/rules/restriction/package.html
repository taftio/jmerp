Provides for restriction support to a Merp Character.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
Many objects that are applied to a Merp Character have certain restrictions
about what the various other objects set to a Merp Character can be.  For
example, by applying a attribute like Dwarf to a character, there must be
a restriction added that this character cannot be a Mage.  This should be done
by adding a restrictions to the Dwarf race that will veto any attemp to
change the profession property to a Mage.
</P>
<p>
To use the support on your object, it must implement the <code>IRestrictable</code>
interface.  This identifies that it has a restriction list assocated with it.
When this object is added as a value to the MerpCharacter, it will pull out
the restriction list and add all of the restrictions on to the MerpCharacter so
that they will be checked moving forward.  If this property is ever removed from
the Merp Character (as may be the case for items), the character will remove
all associated restrictions as well.
