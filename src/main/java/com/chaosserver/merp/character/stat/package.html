<P>
Provides creation, storing and manipulation of the basic information of a
list of character stats.  This basic implemenation is read-only.
</P>

<P>
It is doubtful this implementation will be used when attempting to create
a new character since it provides no factory for creating a statlist and
no methods to swap or manipulate the values in the stats.  Yet it should
be subclassed to create different algorithms for stat manipulation as well
as used once characters have been created
