Method for asserting system conditions are true.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
Assertion are used by a programmer to validate that system conditions are true.
This goes with the programming by contract model.  When a method is first entered
the programmer should have a list of assertions about the state of input parameters
and the system state.

This allows one to quickly identify when a piece of code isn't used properly.
