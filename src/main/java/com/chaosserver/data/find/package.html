Mechanisms for working with findable objects in a system.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
There are bunch of system lists that contain singleton objects.
When writing and loading methods into beans findable objects
should not be written and needed to be loaded using the
proper system finder.
</p>
<p>
System level objects implement the findable interface allowing
the writer and loader to manipulate them properly.
